## What problem are we trying to solve
This project was created to assist people that want to know the current and future weather conditions for a given city. The user will be able to see the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, uv index, and an icon representation of the weather. The user will also be able to see a 5-day forecast of the given location showing the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representation of the weather for each day. The user is able to click on cities in the search history to once again see current and future weather conditions.

## Requirements
- When the user searches for a city then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that cityis added to the search history.
- When the user views the current weather conditions for that city then they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representaion of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV Index.
- When the user views the UV Index then they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- When the user views future weather conditions for that city then they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
- When the user clicks on a city in the search history then they are again presented with the current and future conditions for that city.

## Notes
I believe that this project went well for the most part. Whilst doing this assignment I learned that I need to create more functions that do less in my future work. I noticed that with how I am currently creating functions that they do too much and if one thing breaks it's hard to tell where it's breaking and why. I just need more separation of powers in my JavaScript.
